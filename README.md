# ScanIP
Designed to check customer's IPs via CSV to see if they have the top 100 ports open.

Requires NMap to be installed onto your device to call the function, currently this only scans top 100 ports, otherwise it'll be a very slow process script.
This application isn't signed, just compiled to make it easier than running the script, if you need to run or edit the source, just install python-nmap and python on to your device.
