## 🤌 What is it?
Super simple tool for checking for exposed ports via CSV list with NMap, with quick functions for Top 100, All or Selected Ports

## 👾 Why Bulk Port Scanner?

Requires only NMap to be installed, doesn't send results or information anywhere. 

Fully private. Always.

## 🚄 Speed of Testing

Bulk Port Scanner uses the NMap function for the core process of scanning, in ideal testing NMap can scan a host within 1/5th of a second for a port.

To scan every single port, will take longer however, so I recommend you stick to the top 100 which takes a couple seconds per IP or enter the ports you want to scan.

There is a built-in 1 second delay between IP, this is on purpose to ensure no overloading happens - feel free to remove if you want it even quicker.

_This application isn't signed, just compiled to make it easier than running the script, if you need to run or edit the source, just install python-nmap and python on to your device. Anti Viruses might get angry at this just fyi_

----

By using this tool, you accept that you have full authority to scan the public IP from the owner of it.
