## ðŸš„ Speed of Testing

Bulk Port Scanner uses the NMap function for the core process of scanning, in ideal testing NMap can scan a host within 1/5th of a second for a port.

To scan every single port, will take longer however, so I recommend you stick to the top 100 which takes a couple seconds per IP or enter the ports you want to scan.

There is a built-in 1 second delay between IP, this is on purpose to ensure no overloading happens - feel free to remove if you want it even quicker.

## ðŸ“– Prerequisites

Main Application for Scanning - You will need to install NMap for the function to work - https://nmap.org/

Results Reviewer Beta Feature - Currently still requires Python to be installed onto the machine while this feature is in beta

---


_This application isn't signed, just compiled to make it easier than running the script, if you need to run or edit the source, just install python-nmap and python on to your device. Anti Viruses might get angry at this just fyi_

----

By using this tool, you accept that you have full authority to scan the public IP from the owner of it.
